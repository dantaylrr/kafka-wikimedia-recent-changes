Still to do:

1). Tests for each application.
2). Update README to guide on how to run both applications.
3). Would be nicer if a better way to manage virtual environments existed in mono-repo's, as creating 3 is semi-confusing.
4). Tidying up source code (i.e. producer logs only visible after application has stopped, try/excepts, etc etc.).
5). Run consumer application on spark cluster hosted inside docker container.
6). Terraform for AWS resources that are being used? (IAM User + Role & S3 buckets)?
